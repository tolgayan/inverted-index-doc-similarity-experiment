# Hi!

In this repo, I have done some experiments with inverted index algorithm for calculating pairwise document vector similarities. I have compared it with brute force approach, and I have observed the effects of preprocessing the data.

I have a blog post which goes over the codes and explains some concepts:

Data is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/savasy/ttc4900.
